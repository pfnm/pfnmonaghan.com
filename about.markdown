My name is Peter Monaghan. I am an author, researcher and documentarian. 

I enjoy deep dives, into a plethora of subjects, from chemistry, to combat.
I'm also the editor at Golimetry, where I focus on the Copa Libertadores.
You can see my work at Golimetry (via YouTube, for instance). 
This is an archive for my written work outside of football.
Thanks for taking an interest.
